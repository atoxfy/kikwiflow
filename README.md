<h3 align="center">A modern, lightweight, and embeddable process orchestration engine for the JVM.</h3>

The Manifesto: We Believe in **Code**, We Believe in **Brazil**.

[Kikwiflow](https://kikwiflow.com/) was born from a conviction: that Brazilian engineering possesses the talent, creativity, and grit to create world-class technology. This project is our answer to the status quo, proof that we can build software tools that not only compete but define the future of global technology.

We are not here to replicate, but to innovate. To question legacy architectures and propose smarter, faster solutions that are more aligned with the needs of the modern developer.

This is an open invitation to all Brazilian talents who share this vision.

<h2>What is kikwiflow?</h2>
[Kikwiflow](https://kikwiflow.com/) is an open-source process engine, written in Java, designed to orchestrate business logic directly within your applications.

Unlike traditional solutions that operate as heavy, centralized servers, [Kikwiflow](https://kikwiflow.com/) is a lightweight and embeddable library. It lives alongside your code, eliminating infrastructural complexity, reducing latency, and offering a fluid and integrated development experience.

**Our philosophy is focused on**:

**Extreme Performance**: Using a modern stack with Java 21+ (Virtual Threads) and MongoDB, we are built for high throughput and low latency.

**Architectural Simplicity**: By being embeddable, Kikwiflow drastically simplifies your environment, reducing costs and points of failure.

**Developer Experience**: With native integration with Spring Boot and compatibility with market standards like Camunda's JavaDelegate, we want developers to feel right at home.

<h2>High-Level Roadmap</h2>
Our development is focused on two major strategic deliveries:

üöÄ **Delivery 1**: The Complete Engine (Compatibility and Performance)

Objective: To launch a complete, open-source process engine with the goal of being 100% backward compatible with the main elements of Camunda BPM. We aim to offer a real and low-friction modernization alternative for the community, with clear advantages in performance and simplicity.

üß† **Delivery 2**: The Predictive Engine (Intelligence Plugins)

Objective: After establishing market trust, we will introduce our disruptive differentiator: a layer of AI plugins. These modules will allow the engine to learn from executions, autonomously optimize processes, and provide predictive insights, transforming automation into intelligent orchestration.

<h2>Project Status</h2>
[Kikwiflow](https://kikwiflow.com/) is in an active development phase. We are working hard on Delivery 1 and invite the community to follow our progress.

<h2>How to Contribute</h2>
We are still structuring our contribution process, but if our vision resonates with you, feel free to open an Issue to start a discussion. All ideas are welcome!
